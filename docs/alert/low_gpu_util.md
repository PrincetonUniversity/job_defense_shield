# Low GPU Utilization

This alert identifies users with low GPU efficiency.

## Configuration File

Below is an example entry for `config.yaml`:

```yaml
low-gpu-efficiency-1:
  cluster: della
  partitions:
    - gpu
  min_run_time:         30  # minutes
  eff_thres_pct:        25  # percent
  eff_target_pct:       50  # percent
  absolute_thres_hours: 50  # gpu-hours
  proportion_thres_pct:  2  # percent
  num_top_users:        15  # count
  email_file: "low_gpu_efficiency.txt"
  admin_emails:
    - admin@institution.edu
```

The available settings are listed below:

- `cluster`: Specify the cluster name as it appears in the Slurm database.

- `partitions`: Specify one or more Slurm partitions. The number of GPU-hours is summed over all partitions.

- `eff_thres_pct`: Efficiency threshold percentage. Users with a GPU efficiency of less than or equal to this value will be considered to receive an email.

- `eff_target_pct`: The minimum acceptable GPU utilization for a user. This quantity is not used in any calculations but it can be referenced using `<TARGET>` in the email file.

- `absolute_thres_hours`: Absolute threshold hours. A user must have allocated more than this number of GPU-hours to receive an email.

- `email_file`: The text file to be used as the email message to users.

- `num_top_users`: (Optional) After sorting all users by GPU-hours, only consider the top `num_top_users` for all remaining calculations and emails. This is used to limit the number of users that receive emails and appear in reports. Default: 15

- `min_run_time`: (Optional) The number of minutes that a job must have ran to be considered. Default: 0

- `proportion_thres_pct`: (Optional) Proportion threshold percentage. A user must be using at least this proportion of the total GPU-hours (as a percentage) in order to be sent an email. For example, setting this to 2 will exclude all users that are using less than 2% of the total GPU-hours. Default: 0

- `nodelist`: (Optional) Only apply this alert to jobs that ran on the specified nodes. See [example](../nodelist.md).

- `excluded_users`: (Optional) List of usernames to exclude from receiving emails.

- `admin_emails`: (Optional) List of administrator email addresses that should receive copies of the emails that are sent to users.

- `email_subject`: (Optional) Subject of the email message to users.

- `report_title`: (Optional) Title of the report to system administrators.

## Report for System Administrators

Here is an example of the report:

```

## Email Message to Users

Below is an example email (see `email/low_gpu_efficiencies.txt`):

```
Hello Alan (u12345),

Over the last 7 days you have used the 3rd most GPU-hours on della (pli-c) but
your mean GPU efficiency is only 29%:

     User  Partition(s)  Jobs  GPU-hours GPU-rank Efficiency
    jg9945    pli-c       65     2345      3/53      29%    

A good target value for "Efficiency" is 75% and above. Please investigate the
reason for the low efficiency.

Replying to this automated email will open a support ticket with Research
Computing.
```

### Placeholders

The following placeholders can be used in the email file:

- `<GREETING>`: The greeting generated by `greeting-method`.
- `<CLUSTER>`: The name of the cluster as defined in `config.yaml`.
- `<PARTITIONS>`: A comma-separated list of the partitions used by the user.
- `<EFFICIENCY>`: The mean GPU efficiency of the user.
- `<RANK>`: The GPU-rank of the user as determined by number of allocated GPU-hours.
- `<DAYS>`: Number of days in the time window (default is 7).
- `<TARGET>`: The value of `eff_target_pct` from the alert settings.
- `<TABLE>`: A table of showing mean efficiency and other values for the user.
- `<JOBSTATS>`: The `jobstats` command for the first job of the user.

## Usage

Generate a report of the top users with low GPU efficiencies:

```
$ job_defense_shield --low-gpu-efficiency
```

Send emails to users with low GPU efficiencies over the past 7 days:

```
$ job_defense_shield --low-gpu-efficiency --email
```

See which users have received emails and when:

```
$ job_defense_shield --low-gpu-efficiency --check
```

## cron

Below is an example entry for `crontab`:

```
0 9 * * * /path/to/job_defense_shield --low-gpu-efficiency --email > /path/to/log/low_gpu_efficiency.log 2>&1
```
