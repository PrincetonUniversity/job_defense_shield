# Jobs with 0% CPU Utilization

This alert identifies single and multinode jobs with 0% CPU utilization. For multinode jobs, it identifies the number of nodes with 0% utilization.

## Configuration File

Below is an example entry for `config.yaml`:

```yaml
zero-cpu-utilization-1:
  cluster: stellar
  partitions:
    - cpu
  min_run_time: 61 # minutes
  email_file: "zero_cpu_utilization.txt"
  admin_emails:
    - admin@institution.edu
```

The parameters are explained below:

- `cluster`: Specify the cluster name as it appears in the Slurm database.

- `partitions`: Specify one or more Slurm partitions.

- `email_file`: The text file to be used for the email message.

- `min_run_time`: (Optional) Minimum run time in minutes for a job to be included in the calculation. For example, if `min_run_time: 30` is used then jobs that ran for less than 30 minutes are ignored. Default: 0

- `cpu_hours_threshold`: (Optional) Only users with greater than or equal to this number of CPU-hours at 0% utilization will receive an email. Default: 0

- `email_subject`: (Optional) Subject of the email message to users.

- `include_running_jobs`: (Optional) If `True` then jobs in a state of `RUNNING` will be included in the calculation. The Prometheus server must be queried for each running job, which can be an expensive operation. Default: False

- `nodelist`: (Optional) Only apply this alert to jobs that ran on the specified nodes. See [example](../nodelist.md).

- `excluded_users`: (Optional) List of usernames to exclude from receiving emails.

- `admin_emails`: (Optional) The emails sent to users will also be sent to these administator emails. This applies
when the `--email` option is used.

## Report for System Administrators

## Email Message to Users

Below is an example email to a user (see `email/zero_cpu_utilization.txt`):

```
Hello Alan (u12345),

Below are your recent jobs that did not use all of the allocated nodes:

     JobID  Cluster  Nodes  Nodes-Unused CPU-Util-Unused  Cores Hours
    1931133 stellar   11         11             0%        1056   48 
    1932935 stellar   11         11             0%        1056   48 

The CPU utilization was found to be 0% on each of the unused nodes. Please
investigate this issue before running additional jobs.

Replying to this automated email will open a support ticket with Research
Computing.
```

### Placeholders

The following placeholders can be used in the email file:

- `<GREETING>`: The greeting generated by `greeting-method`.
- `<CLUSTER>`: The cluster specified for the alert (i.e., `cluster`).
- `<PARTITIONS>`: The partitions listed for the alert (i.e., `partitions`).
- `<DAYS>`: Number of days in the time window (default is 7).
- `<NUM-JOBS>`: Total number of jobs with at least one idle CPU.
- `<TABLE>`: Table of job data.
- `<JOBSTATS>`: `jobstats` command for the first JobID (`$ jobstats 12345678`).

## Usage

Send emails to offending users:

```
$ python job_defense_shield.py --zero-cpu-utilization --email
```
