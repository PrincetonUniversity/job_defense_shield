# Installation

We assume that the [Jobstats](https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/jobstats) platform is available and working.

!!! info "Cancelling Jobs at 0% GPU Utilization"
    To automatically cancel actively running jobs, the software must be ran as a user with sufficient privileges to call `scancel`. This may inform your decision of where to install the software and by which user. All of the other alerts and reports can be ran as a regular user.

Python 3.7 is the minimum supported version. The required dependencies for Job Defense Shield are `pandas`, `pyarrow`, `pyyaml` and `requests`. The `requests` module is needed to address the underutilization of actively running jobs. In this case, the Prometheus server must be queried.

Job Defense Shield can be installed from PyPI:

```
$ pip install job-defense-shield
```

To install the software into an isolated environment:

```
$ python -m venv jds-env
$ source jds-env/bin/activate
(jds-env) $ pip install --upgrade pip
(jds-env) $ pip install job-defense-shield
```

At a later time, to upgrade to the latest version:

```
(jds-env) $ pip install --upgrade job-defense-shield
```

It is strongly recommended to use the latest version.

## Testing the Installation

The simplest test is to run the help menu:

```
$ job_defense_shield --help
```

If the command above failed then see [Troubleshooting the Installation](#troubleshooting-the-installation).

Next, try running a simple informational alert. To do this, make a trivial configuration file called `config.yaml` in the current working directory:

```
$ cat config.yaml
```
```yaml
%YAML 1.1
---
#####################
## GLOBAL SETTINGS ##

violation-logs-path: /path/to/writable/directory/

email-domain-name: "@institution.edu"
sender: support@institution.edu
reply-to: support@institution.edu
report-emails:

```

!!! tip
    If the path that you specified for `violation-logs-path` does not exist then the software will try to make it. You can use any valid path for now. In the next section, you will choose the production paths for `violation-logs-path` and `email-files-path`.

Be sure to replace `email-domain-name`, `sender`, `reply-to` and `report-emails` with your values.

To test the software, run this command (which does not send any emails):

```
$ job_defense_shield --usage-overview
```

The command above will show an overview of the number of CPU-hours and GPU-hours
across all clusters and partitions in the Slurm database over the past 7 days. Here is an example:

```
$ job_defense_shield --usage-overview

You can go further back in time by using the `--days` option:

```
$ job_defense_shield --usage-overview --days=14
```

!!! info
    Using a large value for the `--days` option can cause the Slurm database to fail to produce the data. The default is 7 days.

One can only include data from specific clusters or partitions using the `-M` and `-r` options from `sacct`:

```
$ job_defense_shield --usage-overview -M della -r cpu,gpu
```
Or equivalently:

```
$ job_defense_shield --usage-overview --clusters=della --partition=cpu,gpu
```

The `-M` and `-r` options (or `--clusters` and `--partition`) can be used to reduce the load on the database server when an alert only applies to a particular cluster or particular partitions. These options are passed through to `sacct`. See `man sacct` for more information.

## Email Test

By having your email address in `report-emails` in `config.yaml`, the `--report` flag can be used to send the output to administrators by email:

```
$ job_defense_shield --usage-overview --report
```

This feature is useful when combined with `cron`. That is, one can receive a daily report showing all of the instances of underutilization across all of the systems (see [reports](reports/overview.md)).

## Troubleshooting the Installation

Make sure you are using the `python` in the isolated environment. All three commands below should run successfully:

```
$ python --version
$ python -c "import pandas; print(pandas.__version__)"
$ python -c "import pyyaml; print(pyyaml.__version__)"
```

If the configuration file is not found then try specifying the full path:

```
$ job_defense_shield --config-file=/path/to/config.yaml --usage-overview --report
```
 
## Creating a Configuration File for Production

See the [next section](configuration.md) to learn how to write a proper configuration file.
