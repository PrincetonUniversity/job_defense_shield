<GREETING>

Below are <CASE> that ran on <CLUSTER> (<PARTITIONS>) in the past <DAYS> days:

<TABLE>

It appears that you are requesting too much CPU memory for your jobs since you
are only using on average <PERCENT> of the allocated memory (for the <NUM-JOBS> jobs). This
has resulted in <UNUSED> TB-hours of unused memory which is equivalent to making
<NUM-WASTED-NODES> nodes unavailable to all users (including yourself) for one week! A TB-hour is
the allocation of 1 terabyte of memory for 1 hour.

Please request less memory by modifying the --mem-per-cpu or --mem Slurm
directive. A good target value for Percent-Used is 80% and above. For more
on allocating CPU memory with Slurm:

You can check the CPU memory utilization of completed and actively running jobs
by using the "jobstats" command. For example:
