<GREETING>

Over the last <DAYS> days you have used <RANK> GPU-hours on <CLUSTER> (<PARTITIONS>) but
your mean GPU efficiency is only <EFFICIENCY>:

<TABLE>

A good target value for "Efficiency" is <TARGET> and above. Please investigate the reason
for the low efficiency. Common reasons for low GPU efficiency are discussed here:

    https://researchcomputing.princeton.edu/support/knowledge-base/gpu-computing#low-util

Consult the documentation or write to the mailing list of the software that you
are using for additional reasons for low GPU efficiency. You may also consider
attending an in-person Research Computing help session:

You can check the efficiency of completed and actively running jobs by using the
"jobstats" command on a given JobID:
