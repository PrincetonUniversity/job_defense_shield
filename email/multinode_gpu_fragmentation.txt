<GREETING>

Below are jobs that ran on <CLUSTER> (<PARTITONS>) in the past <DAYS> days:

<TABLE>

The GPU nodes on <CLUSTER> (<PARTITONS>) have <GPUS-PER-NODE> GPUs per node. For future jobs,
please try to use as few nodes as possible by allocating more GPUs per node. This
is done by modifying the --gres Slurm directive as explained here:

In any of your jobs have a low GPU utilization then please consider using only
a single GPU per job to improve efficiency.
