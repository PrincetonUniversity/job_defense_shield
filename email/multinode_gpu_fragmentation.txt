<GREETING>

Below are jobs that ran on <CLUSTER> (<PARTITONS>) in the past <DAYS> days:

<TABLE>

The GPU nodes on <CLUSTER> (<PARTITONS>) have <GPUS-PER-NODE> GPUs per node. For future jobs,
please try to use as few nodes as possible by allocating more GPUs per node.
That is, please allocate all of the GPUs within a node before splitting your
job across multiple nodes. This is done by modifying the --nodes and --gres
Slurm directives as explained here:

    https://researchcomputing.princeton.edu/support/knowledge-base/slurm#gpus

In any of your jobs have a low GPU utilization then please consider using only
a single GPU per job to improve efficiency.
