<GREETING>

Below are jobs that ran on <CLUSTER> (<PARTITIONS>) in the past <DAYS> days:

<TABLE>

The GPU nodes on <CLUSTER> (<PARTITIONS>) have <GPUS-PER-NODE> GPUs per node. For future jobs,
please allocate all of the GPUs within a node before splitting your job
across multiple nodes. This is done by decreasing the value of the
--nodes Slurm directive and increasing the value of --gres, as explained here:

If any of your jobs have a low GPU utilization then please consider using a
smaller number of GPUs per job to improve efficiency.
