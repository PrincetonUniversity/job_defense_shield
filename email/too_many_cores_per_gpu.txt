<GREETING>Your <NAME> jobs may be using more CPU-cores per GPU than necessary:

<TABLE>

Each node on <NAME> has <CORES> CPU-cores and <GPUS> GPUs. If possible please try
to use only up to <TARGET> CPU-cores per GPU. This will prevent the situation
where there are free GPUs on a node but not enough CPU-cores to accept new
jobs.
