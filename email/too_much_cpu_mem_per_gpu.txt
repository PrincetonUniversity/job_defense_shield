<GREETING>

Your <NAME> jobs appear to be allocating more CPU memory than necessary:

<TABLE>

Each node on <NAME> has <MEMORY> GB of CPU memory and <GPUS> GPUs. If possible please
allocate <TARGET> GB of CPU memory per GPU or less. This will prevent the situation
where there are free GPUs on a node but not enough CPU memory to accept new jobs.

"Mem-Eff" is the memory efficiency or the ratio of used to allocated CPU memory.
A good target value for this quantity is 80% and above. Please use an accurate
value for the --mem, --mem-per-cpu or --mem-per-gpu Slurm directive. For the
job(s) above, one could have used:

   #SBATCH --mem-per-gpu=<SLURM>G
