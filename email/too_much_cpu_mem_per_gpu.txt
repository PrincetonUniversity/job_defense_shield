<GREETING>

Your <NAME> jobs appear to be allocating more CPU memory than necessary:

<TABLE>

Each node on <NAME> has <MEMORY> GB of CPU memory and <GPUS> GPUs. If possible please
only allocate up to the soft limit of <TARGET> GB of CPU memory per GPU. This will
prevent the situation where there are free GPUs on a node but not enough CPU
memory to accept new jobs.

"Mem-Eff" is the memory efficiency or the ratio of used to allocated CPU memory.
A good target value for this quantity is 80% and above. Please use an accurate
value for the --mem, --mem-per-cpu or --mem-per-gpu Slurm directive. For job
<JOBID>, one could have used:

    #SBATCH --mem-per-gpu=<MEM-PER-GPU>G
